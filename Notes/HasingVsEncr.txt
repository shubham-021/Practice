Hashing vs. Encryption


Hashing and encryption are both cryptographic techniques used for data security, but they serve different purposes and have fundamental differences:



Hashing

One-way process : Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash value) that cannot be reversed to obtain the original data
Same input always produces same output: Identical data will always generate identical hash values
Fixed output length: Regardless of input size, the output hash has a consistent length
Primary uses: Password storage, data integrity verification, checksums
Examples: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt, Argon2

Encryption

Two-way process: Data is transformed using an algorithm and can be decrypted back to its original form
Requires a key: Uses encryption keys to transform data and decrypt it
Variable output length: Generally proportional to input size
Primary uses: Secure communication, protecting sensitive data during storage or transit
Examples: AES, RSA, DES, Blowfish

Key Differences

Reversibility: Encryption is reversible (with the right key); hashing is not
Purpose: Encryption protects data confidentiality; hashing verifies data integrity and authenticity
Keys: Encryption requires keys for both processes; hashing doesn't require keys (though some hash functions can use keys)
Output consistency: Hash functions produce the same output for identical inputs; encryption typically produces different outputs even for the same input (due to initialization vectors or nonces)
